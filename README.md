There are two main ways that academics engage with the public via digital humanities. The first way is by building a personal digital presence. This includes creating a CV website, blogging, social media, and any other activity that places you in the public eye. The second way is by designing, building, and maintaining public educational products.

## The Benefits of Having a Digital Presence
Having a digital presence is a way to network while also displaying your media savviness. Both of these aspects is good for professional prospects since it means sharing your research and attaching your name to your topic. 

## Ways to Become Searchable/Findable
Blog (Weebly and WordPress are two popular blogging platforms)
Create a personal or C.V. website
Twitter for academics
Facebook
Instagram

## Writing for the Public

Keep your message simple
Know your audience
Tailor your narrative to your audience
